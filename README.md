# Music Genre Classification

This project explores the classification of music genres using linear algebra tools, primarily Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). FFT converts audio signals into frequency-domain representations, and SVD is applied for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. The classification component leverages Support Vector Machines (SVM), relying on principles of linear algebra for its operation. The model was trained on the GTZAN dataset. Using the presented methods, the accuracy percentage for the 10 music genres is 80.00%, and the F1 score is 80.02%
